Help:  I think I need the most help understanding how to work with spawning multiple objects, and then being able to work with them later, either to pick a specific one outor globally do something to them all, like pause or remove them entirely.  along those lines, here are some specifics#1:  transition pausing:  This is the biggie.  transition.to() works great here.  the main thing is that the onComplete portion "per ansca documentation" sends					self to the function it is calling.  HOWEVER, I need to be able to pause all the transitions and re-start them on a regular basis.  To do this					I tried using the cool code provided by Alfred R. Baudisch http://www.karnakgames.com.  "transitionManager.lua" allows me to exchange					transition.to() with tm:add.  The PROBLEM i am having is that passing self no longer works and the app crashes the first time it reaches a "onComplete" statement.					Bummer!  try commenting out the transitions with "tm:add" and un-commenting "transition.to".  works fine then.#2:  removing spawned objects (that i nested inside groups) properly.  I'm sure I am not doing this right.  run the program and try clicking on 					the baddies as soon as they come out.  after a few clicks, i get an error.#3:  pausing sprite animations.  doing this with a single objects is easy, but when i spawn them, I am clearly not doing something right.					by hitting the pause button, you will see that I am only affecting the last one created.	]]
